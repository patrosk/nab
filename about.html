          NAB Trio combines different traditions, genres and expressions, where
          original compositions are blended with free improvisations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The trio plays music that blends traditions and genres, with
          influences from folk music, western classical music, jazz, rock and
          experimental music. NAB Trio plays music composed by its members, but
          improvisation is an integral part of the music. NAB Trio has performed
          with guests as NABplus. In 2019, NABplus performed with a duo from
          South India at Vävra Musik- och Kulturfestival;
          <strong>Arun Shiva Ganesh</strong> (percussion) and
          <strong>Sangeetha Ravindranath</strong> (voice). This concert was
          recorded and has been released as the album

          (meaning “bridges” in the South Indian language Kannada), available on
          Spotify and YouTube. In 2020, NAB Trio again performed at Vävra Musik-
          och Kulturfestival with two concerts, this time with guest Hakim
          Mirza, renowned poet from northern Iraq. Together, they presented
          concerts with poetry and composed as well as improvised music. The
          first concert was performed in Vävra and was broadcast live on the
          internet and the second concert was performed at Mimers Hus Teater
          with limited audience. In 2021, NAB Trio performed at the jazz club
          Brötz in Gothenburg with a concert that was broadcast live on YouTube.

          <strong>Nema Vinkeloe Uuskyla</strong> is a skilled musician who has
          performed in different constellations in Sweden, Germany, Uganda, USA
          and India. With her roots in western classical music and folk music,
          her musicianship is a mix of different traditions, expressions and
          improvisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Annika Törnqvist</strong> is an experienced musician playing
          in different groups, ranging from pop and rock to jazz and fusion. She
          has toured with Swedish pop star Jessica Andersson in 2019 and 2020
          and has given concerts and performed at festivals in several countries
          across Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Biggi Vinkeloe</strong> is one of few female musicians of her
          generation that has influenced free jazz and improvisational music.
          She has recorded and released over 40 albums and toured in North
          America, Europe and Asia. She has initiated many genre-bending
          projects where music is combined with other art forms such as dance,
          visual arts and poetry.
        </p>
        <p>
          NAB Trio's guest <strong>Hakim Mirza</strong> is a poet and car
          mechanic from Kurdistan, who has written poetry since childhood about
          life, society and spirituality. His poetry has been widely praised and
          gained recognition; he has released several books, made numerous
          appearances in Kurdish television and has fans all over the world.
          Because his poetry also presents social criticism and has questioned
          and criticised politicians, Hakim was eventually forced to flee his
          country and came to Sweden. In Sweden he works as a car mechanic and
          this is how NAB Trio met him; during spring 2020 they made their first
          collaboration where Biggi and Nema played while Hakim read one of his
          poems on a live stream on Facebook.
